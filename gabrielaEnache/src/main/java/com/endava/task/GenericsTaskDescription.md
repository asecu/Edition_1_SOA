1. Consider an integer array and a string array. Write a single method `printArray` that  
   can print all elements of both arrays. The method should be able to accept both integer 
   arrays or string arrays.   
   
2. Design a class `Library` that can contain media of kinds: book, video, newspaper.
    Create a version of the class `Library` that uses generics and one version that does not.    
    Add methods for storing and retrieving media (all, by name etc.) and    
    feel free to create any additional APIs that you consider necessary.
